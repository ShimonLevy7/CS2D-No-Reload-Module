# CS2D-No-Reload-Module
Grants the ability to fire endlessly without ever having to reload.

Hello! This is a fairly simple script.
I'm aware that there are alternative scripts, but I'm certain that this one would stand out, as it is a lot faster and considerably more modern.

Features:
- You can easily add &/ remove weapons and you can even enable the no reload function on all weapons
- Will hide the ammo HUD
- Will enable infinite ammo to counter strange cases where you'd run out of ammo, or pickup an empty weapon and be unable to reload.
- I didn't include a reload hook to support the above, but that can easily be added manually, or requested. Though, it's really unnecessary
- Easy to configure, read, understand and use
- Highly efficient & compact
- A single hook is used
- Only one for loop is used, and it only runs at the beginning of the script (could be omitted, but remains for user simplicity)

**You must add the `mt.NoReload.lua` script to the `autorun` folder or the `server.lua` file, otherwise it will not execute.**
